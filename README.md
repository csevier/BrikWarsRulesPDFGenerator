This requires powershell 7. Installer here:
https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.2.6/PowerShell-7.2.6-win-x64.msi

Open Powershell 7 as Admin by right clicking it and clicking "Run as Admin"

then run this script with ./CreateBrikWarsRules.ps1

It will download its dependencies if you dont have them so just follow the installers instructions. This only happens once.

You rules will the be downloaded in a BrikWars folder in your Downloads.

Open BrikWarsRules.pdf and laugh your ass off. 


To do: Make year agnostic.
